I am a bioinformatics scientist, genomics researcher, and systems thinker passionate about plant/fungal genomes, evolutionary genomics, and using large datasets to discover hidden patterns in biology. My work sits at the intersection of computational biology, high-performance computing, and translational research with a focus on driving multidisciplinary discoveries across diverse scientific domains.     
I enjoy travelling, exploring different cultures and landscapes. I am passionate about scientific epistemology and the philosophy of science, often spending time reading and reflecting on how knowledge is constructed and advanced through scientific inquiry.
