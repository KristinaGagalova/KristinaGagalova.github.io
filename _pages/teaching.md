Iâ€™m an active instructor with The Carpentries, a global organization dedicated to teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers across disciplines.
Through hands-on workshops, I help scientists become more competent in using tools like shell scripting, Git, R, Python, and workflow systems.
